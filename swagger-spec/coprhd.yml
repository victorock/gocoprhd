        Create Volume Snapshot
      description: |
        A snapshot is a point-in-time copy of a volume. Snapshots are intended
        for short-term operational recovery and are typically implemented using
        lightweight, fast capabilities native to the underlying storage
        platforms. Like a volume, a snapshot can be exported to initiators,
        and you can delete it. A snapshots lifetime is tied to the original
        volume. When the original volume is deleted all of its snapshots will
        also be deleted. A snapshot is associated with the same project as the
        original volume. A volume may be restored in place based on a snapshot.
        The snapshot must have come from the volume. A new volume may be created
         using a snapshot as a template. See multi-volume consistent snapshots
         for a description of an advanced feature to snapshot multiple volumes
         at once. NOTE: This is an asynchronous operation.

        Create Export
      description: |
        Block export method is use to export one or more volumes to one or more
        hosts. This is a required step for a host to be able to access a block
        volume, although in some scenarios, additional configurations may be
        required. There are three main types of export group to meet the common
        use cases:

        Create an initiator type export group so that a single host can see one
        or more volumes. An example would be an export group for a host boot lun
        or a private volume that is meant to be used by only one host. The
        assumption is, in this case the user wants the boot or private volume
        to be accessed via known initiators. For this type of export, the
        request object is expected to have only initiators (i.e. no hosts or
        clusters). Further, the initiators are expected to belong to the same
        host. While an initiator type export group can belong to only one host,
        this does not mean the host can only have the initiator type export
        group. A hosts can be part of many export groups of any type. The export
        group type {@link ExportGroupType#Initiator} should be specified in the
        request for this type of export.

        Create an export group so that one or more hosts, which are not part of
        a cluster, can access one or more volumes. This is the use case of a
        shared data lun. In this case, it is assumed that the user wants all the
        hosts initiators that are connected to the storage array (up to the
        maximum specified by the virtual pool) to be able to access the volume.
        The export group type {@link ExportGroupType#Host} should be specified
        in the request for this type of export.

        Create an export group so that one or more clusters of hosts can access
        one or more volumes. This is the same use case of shared data lun as the
        {@link ExportGroupType#Host} use case with the exception that the user
        is managing a cluster of hosts as opposed to individual hosts. In this
        case, the same assumption about the initiators as in the previous case
        is made. The export group type {@link ExportGroupType#Cluster} should be
        specified in the request for this type of export.

        Note that the above discussion only mentions volumes but mirrors and
        snapshots can also be used in export groups.

        Once a block export is created, following incremental changes can be
        applied to it:
          - add volume or volume snapshot to the shared storage pool
          - remove volume or volume snapshot from the shared storage pool
          - add new server to the cluster by adding initiator from that server
            to the block export - remove visibility of shared storage to a
            server by removing initiators from the block export

        Similar to block storage provisioning, block export is also created
        within the scope of a varray. Hence, volumes and snapshots being added
        to a block export must belong to the same varray. Fibre Channel and
        iSCSI initiators must be part of SANs belonging to the same varray as
        block export.

        For Fibre Channel initiators, SAN zones will also be created when the
        export group is created if the networks are discovered and:

        at least one of the Network Systems can provision the Vsan or Fabric in
        which the each endpoint exists, and the VirtualArray has
        "auto_san_zoning" set to true.

        The SAN zones each consists of an initiator (from the arguments) and a
        storage port that is selected. The number of zones created will be
        determined from the number of required initiator/storage-port
        communication paths.

            Add/remove clusters
            Add/remove hosts
            Add/remove initiators

        Depending on the export group type (Initiator, Host or Cluster), the
        request is restricted to enforce the same rules as
        {@link #createExportGroup(ExportCreateParam)}:
            For initiator type groups, only initiators are accepted in the
            request. Further the initiators must be in the same host as the
            existing initiators.

            For host type groups, only hosts and initiators that belong to
            existing hosts will be accepted.

            For cluster type groups, only clusters, hosts and initiators will
            be accepted. Hosts and initiators must belong to existing clusters
            and hosts.

        Note: The export group name, project and varray can not be modified.
